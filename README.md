# LIRI Bot

### Overview

In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.


LIRI will search Spotify for songs, and OMDB for movies.



1. Direct your terminal/command line to the appropriate folder (which contains liri.js) and run the command 'npm install'
    This will install all the necessary files for liri to work

on movies, or music.
